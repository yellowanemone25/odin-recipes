        <ul>
            <li>250g long grain rice</li>
            <li>3 tsp vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 onion finely chopped</li>
            <li>4 eggs beaten</li>
            <li>2 spring onions, sliced, to serve</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook the rice following pack instructions, then drain, spread it out to steam-dry and set aside.</li>
            <li>Heat 2 tbsp of the oil in a large wok over a high heat, then add the onion and fry until lightly browned, around 5 mins. Add the rice, stir and toast for about 3 mins, then move to the side of the pan.</li>
            <li>Add the remaining oil, then tip in the egg mixture. Leave to cook a little, then mix in with the rice â€“ stir vigorously to coat the grains or, if you prefer the egg chunkier, allow to set for a little longer before breaking up and stirring through. Tip into a serving bowl and scatter over the spring onion to serve. You can also add sesame oil, ground white pepper and a splash of soy sauce to season.</li>
